========================
&nbsp;
## Activator for Windows
<p align="left">
<a href="https://github.com/dysquard/pgpa/releases/download/112/GamepadPro.Active.Tool.rar" target="_blank">  Download Activator(.RAR file, Must on PC)
  </a>
  
</p>

  Extract the .rar file to any folder(better to use `WinRAR` to extract).
  
	
  If you have any trouble with that RAR file, you can <a href="https://github.com/dysquard/pgpa/releases/download/112/GamepadPro.Active.Tool.exe" target="_blank">  Download Exe File(Must on PC).
</a>
  Exe file may be reported as virus but it's all due to signature problem, not a virus at all.
  
  
  **Important** If you're using Windows 7 or below, maybe you should install <a href="http://adb.clockworkmod.com" target="_blank">ADB Driver</a> first.

  


## Activator for Mac
<a href="https://github.com/dysquard/pgpa/releases/download/112/ActivatorMac.zip" target="_blank">  Download Mac Activator(.ZIP file, Mac)
</a>

**Attention** When you're running it, if it prompts `can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer`, just set System Preference > Security & Privacy > Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere.

If you don't see the `Anywhere`, open `Terminal`, type `sudo spctl --master-disable` and return, then input your password (different from usual password interface with `*****`, here you can't see anything from your input) and return. Then `Anywhere` appears.
